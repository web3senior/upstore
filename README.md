## Overview

UP Store & UP Store Shield: A Decentralized App Store on Multichain
Overview
UP Store & UP Store Shield is a decentralized application store (dapp store) platform designed for a multichain environment. It offers users a more secure, censorship-resistant, and user-controlled environment to discover and interact with dapps across various blockchain networks.

### Benefits of dapp stores

- **More censorship resistance:** Because there is no central authority, it is more difficult for dapp stores to be censored. This means that users can access a wider variety of apps, including those that may be banned from traditional app stores.

- **Greater security:**  Blockchain technology is known for its security. This means that dapp stores are generally more resistant to hacking and other forms of cyberattacks.

- **More user control:** Users have more control over their data in dapp stores. This is because dapp stores typically do not require users to create accounts or provide personal information.

- **Browser:** A list of daaps in the Lukso mobile app.

### Access Control

- Only the owner of the contract which is a member of Lusko community or from Lukso team, can change the dapp status
- Owner and only the manager of the dapp can update the dapp metadata and the new manager

### Features

- UP Store:
  - Searchable dapps on LUKSO network.
  - Users can easily find and explore dapps across multiple blockchain networks.
  - The platform supports the growth of innovative dapps on various blockchains
- UP Store Shield:
  - A browser extension that provides verification and security information about dapps, regardless of the underlying blockchain.
- Security:
  - Access control ensures only authorized manager can manage the whitelist.
  - Re-entrancy attacks are prevented using standard security practices.
- Direct donation mechanism:
  - Users can directly donate to and support their favorite dapps, regardless of the blockchain they are on.

Potential Milestones:

Integration of LSP7 tokens: As mentioned in the previous response, UpStore has likely integrated LSP7 tokens into its direct donation mechanism. This would allow users to easily support their favorite dapps on the platform.
Platform optimization: The development team may have focused on optimizing the platform for performance, user experience, and security. This could involve improvements to the user interface, search functionality, and overall usability.
Additional dapp listings: UpStore may have expanded its catalog of dapps, adding more options for users to discover and explore.
Community engagement: The project may have engaged with the LUKSO community to gather feedback and ideas for future development. This could involve participating in forums, social media discussions, or organizing community events.
Adding Arbitrum network: UpStore may have expanded to support the Arbitrum network, allowing users to discover and interact with dapps on this scalable and cost-effective blockchain.
Adding a few Dapp on Arbitrum: If UpStore has added Arbitrum support, it is likely that they have also listed a few dapps built on this network. These dapps could offer a variety of functionalities, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, or social networking.
Overall, it is likely that UpStore has made significant progress since the hackathon. The integration of LSP7 tokens is a notable achievement, and the team has likely focused on other areas to improve the platform and better serve the LUKSO community.
