## Overview

Traditional app stores, like Apple's App Store or Google Play, are controlled by a single entity. This means they have the power to decide what apps get listed, and can even remove them if they violate their guidelines.

Decentralized app stores (dapp stores) are different. They are built on blockchain technology, which distributes control among a network of computers. This means that there is no single authority that can decide what gets listed in a dapp store.

### Benefits of dapp stores

- **More censorship resistance:** Because there is no central authority, it is more difficult for dapp stores to be censored. This means that users can access a wider variety of apps, including those that may be banned from traditional app stores.

- **Greater security:**  Blockchain technology is known for its security. This means that dapp stores are generally more resistant to hacking and other forms of cyberattacks.

- **More user control:** Users have more control over their data in dapp stores. This is because dapp stores typically do not require users to create accounts or provide personal information.

- **Browser:** A list of daaps in the Lukso mobile app.

### Access Control

- Only the owner of the contract which is a member of Lusko community or from Lukso team, can change the dapp status
- Owner and only the manager of the dapp can update the dapp metadata and the new manager

### Motiviation
